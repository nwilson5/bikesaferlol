        Hello, my kid-brother got into biking in recent years and acts invincible and has the tude. He keeps getting hurt and blowing off my suggestions to be more careful so I made this site to make fun of him. Lol!

          Basically, he had trouble seeing the road and crashed going 25 mph so I told him maybe he should ride slower. He said, "going slower won&apos;t help" - I asked what would, he said "being safer" - right, what does that entail dude! Hence, this website.
